_8/19/2005 – took down wiki for now_

So I’m trying a little experiment.

I’ve launched a wiki here as my online sketchbook of half-baked ideas.

It’s not meant to be for communities to collaborate, but for me to roast ideas before they make it to the blog.

~~[Wiki](http://wiki.davidnunez.com)~~

In particular, here are more thoughts related to ~~[Wiki as a sketchbook](http://davidnunezdev.wpengine.com/wiki/index.php?title=Sketchbook)~~.

Rapid iterative development. I’m trying to get better at that; it _feels_ better, at least.
