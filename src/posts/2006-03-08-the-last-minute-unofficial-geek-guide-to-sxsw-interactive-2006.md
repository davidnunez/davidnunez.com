Last year, I wrote The Unofficial Geek Guide to Getting Over Yourself at SxSW Interactive 2005.

This is the new version for 2006. It’s mostly the same. I’m kinda the same. My relentless friendliness is the same. And yes, I’ll have the damn, orange stickers again.

And this year I intend to pull out my PowerBook.

Bookmark this page, I intend to update it frequently over the next 7 days through sxswi.

Regardless, I’m looking forward to meeting you.
