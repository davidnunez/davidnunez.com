I’m Reviewing a whole bunch of urls in a long txt file of collected urls and bookmarks.

Will somebody please create a program or script that randomly selects 5 items from a list of urls, offers them up for quick editing (or rejection) and then opens them in browser — alternatively, just cull n entries from list (w/ option to reject selection) into new file…
