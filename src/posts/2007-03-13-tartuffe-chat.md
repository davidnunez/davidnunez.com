I’m providing the chat server for the Yellow Tape Construction Co. performance of [I Am Not Tartuffe](http://www.austinchronicle.com/arts/2007-03-16/456233/).

The intent is to provide an interactive experience for the show-goers bringing laptops — the [back-channel](http://web.archive.org/web/20090411123446/http://backchannel.stamen.com:80/) as performance art.

I set them up with [PHPFreeChat](http://www.phpfreechat.net/) on a mac mini with a local wireless network. I have no idea what the play is about, but it promises to be [weird and fun](http://yellowtapecc.blogspot.com/2007/03/our-video-rules.html).
