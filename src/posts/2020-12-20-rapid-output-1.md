_This is an experimental blog post to test what it would be like to free write on my iPhone_

Someone told me that composing writing on an iPhone is somehow faster than writing using a normal keyboard. Apparently there is something about the thumb typing that is both physically faster (because of autocomplete) and mentally clarifying (limited context and focus).

Thumb typing does feel like a twenty-first century skill. When I am composing a message in the iPhone, I hear the clicks of my typing as a mesmerizing, hypnotic cadence that pushes me forward along the page. There is a casual nature to this writing that puts it into the same context as a text message. I very rarely put a lot of editing effort into a text message. I think this is because text messages are meant for a receptive audience, but also the form factor of the messaging software is not conducive for a lot of revisions.

If thoughts operate at or faster than the speed of typing, then I would assume that focusing on the mechanics of generating f text using keyboards (virtual or physical) would propel more efficient writing. A natural conclusion would point to modes of typing like stenography as the most efficient documentation modality; does it follow that if stenographers can type faster, they think faster?

Of course stenographers are “merely” transcribing what they are hearing. When I am typing something am I merely transcribing thoughts in my head? This blog post, for example, is a bit of free-writing. I'm attempting to get 500 words down as efficiently as possible. I'm just punching in words without a lot of filtering. I am most certainly thinking faster than my thumbs can move across my iPhone, but am I using the phone’s keyboard to transcribe the voice in my head?

I like the idea of chorded keyboards as a way to capture thoughts while on a walk or otherwise away from a desk. These keyboards operate a lot like a stenography machine where you punch down a small set of keys simultaneously, in a variety of combinations, to render letters. (Stenography is a bit more nuanced; their keyboard combinations yield phonemes and glyphs that are refactored into language post-facto). I imagine an app that would work with a Bluetooth device I carried in my hand to jot notes as I wad taking a walk. Key to this interface would be an audio output piping into my earbuds. It would read back to me what I am typing and perhaps provide prompts. At a bare minimum, it could give me audio feedback as I type to indicate that, yes, I was making progress towards a word count.

I'm finishing this post while sitting on my couch on my iPhone. I will not go back and edit these words. This is an experiment in rapid output for the sake of output. I don't think this post will be of any real value to a reader, but it is demonstrating something to me about momentum.
