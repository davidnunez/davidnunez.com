Returning to a pre-sxsw template for davidnunez.com… finally completing the mephisto to wordpress migration.

I’ve been hacking away at a little app to post/share what I’m going to call “sketchstreams”

I learned a lot about how I _enjoy_ working while getting ready for maker faire.

I’ll be adding features and tweaking the design on the blog in iterations over time rather in fell swoops.

Collect, Wonder, Tinker, Build, Repeat — that should apply here too.
