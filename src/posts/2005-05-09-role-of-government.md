I think government has a role, but it’s limited to 3 things:

1. Protecting our civil rights (including protecting us from fraudulent misbehavior that clouds (i.e. removes) our choices).
2. Protecting us from attack by other nations.

And to a much lesser degree:

3. upkeep of the commons (i.e. infrastructure) – although a lot of this can and should be privatized.

Everything else is liberty crushing.
