This was the panel not to miss!

Tim argues that our own time is most valuable and that economies of arbitrage allow you to outsource far more than we currently outsource…

This exports jobs, obviously, but the hour I free up by delegating fighting with my cell phone company on hold is an hour I can get back to go explore the parts of the world that aren’t top 1% economies.

He would argue that you should use your free time to go “have a life.” I wonder how he would feel about using that freed up time to do more “meaningful work.”
