Generally, there is little to report. Most relevant: I met with my new boss, gearing up for the grand adventure at HBS! We dove into a mixed bag of goodies, chatting about everything from orientation and logistics to hybrid workspaces and hardware. We covered a couple of HR topics and brainstormed a bit about projects in flight and the need to make appropriate connections to other groups at the school and on campus. Bodes well.

Had a nice outing with friends at [Gibbet Hill Grill](https://www.gibbethillgrill.com/?ref=davidnunez.com).

Otherwise, now turning my attention to more structured resetting.
