## Robot Wonders and Wanderings 2012-06-29

* [Robot and Frank Official Trailer #1 (2012)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrQbkjhrANs)

		Near-future setting touches on themes of “robot companions for old people” w/ a dark comedy heist twist. (Frank Langella’s character on his robot): “I need him.” “What do you need him for?” “He’s my friend.”

		Also something in there re: paper books and physical libraries vs. ebooks & internet.

		So, yeah, right up my alley.
