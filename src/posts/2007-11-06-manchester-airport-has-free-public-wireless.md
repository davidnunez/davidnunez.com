It’s not really on the way to or from anything, but FYI: Manchester, NH airport has free, public wireless (not open – one nag/term page to click through).

About 6 weeks ago, I found that I could grab wireless from Cincinnati airport, but alas, this was locked up under some Bell ISP. I did see a computer-to-computer connection named, suspiciously, “Free Public Wireless!” (the exclamation point pushes it over the edge of seediness). Decided to stay offline, instead.
