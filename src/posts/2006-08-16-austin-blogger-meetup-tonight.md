There is another of the monthly [austinbloggers](http://austinbloggers.org/) meetups tonight:

Austin Bloggers’ Monthly Get-Together at Central Market (Lamar & 38th)  
Wed, 16-Aug-2006, 07:00PM

There is some additional [info about them](http://www.austinbloggers.org/blog/a/000449.html) that I wrote, literally, years ago.

Adina Levin also wrote an [interesting article](http://alevin.com/weblog/archives/001834.html) about community sites that references the group.

> Austinbloggers.org grew out of get-togethers of local bloggers. We wanted to have a shared space to post about austin. So we gathered around tables at Mozarts, Brick Oven pizza, Spider House and chatted about the functionality and the rules. With Chip Rosenthal as tech lead and site host, and others including Adam Rice, David Nunez and me, we got started simply. We added features when it seemed like they were needed.
