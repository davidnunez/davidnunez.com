[Austinist: Robots Run Amuck at dorkbot-austin’s Final (Free) Event of the Year](http://www.austinist.com/archives/2006/11/08/robots_run_amuck_at_dorkbotaustins_final_free_event_of_the_year.php):  
  
“Those lovable geeks, mad scientists, rogue artists, and insane inventors are at again, and this time they’re closing out the year with one of their most amazing shows yet, at Cafe Mundi this Thursday.

_What is Dorkbot?_

* It’s a science fair with beer.
* It’s a geek talent show.
* It’s people doing strange things with electricity.
* Best of all, it’s fun, free, kid-friendly and hands-on.

We think dorkbot is exactly what Austin is all about. Nerds, artists, musicians all come together to show off their work in a casual environment. Previous dorkbot events have included singing robots, lightning bolt generators, hacked nintendos, and somebody crazy enough to electrocute a pickle. dorkbot was most recently featured on Austin Technology Matters, a new show on Austin cable access.”
