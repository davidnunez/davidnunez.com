Starting is always the hardest part, dont you think? I definitely have a deep infection of plan-it-out syndrome.

[studentl.inc: Think About Planning Ahead \[5x5s\]](http://studentlinc.typepad.com/studentlinc/2005/09/think_about_pla.html):  

> 5\. Start now. Do something.  
> Some people are addicted to planning (or the idea of planning). They get excited about all the tools you can use to plan, all the latest, hip ideas that planning gurus offer. But their planning ends up being all that there is…just planning. Planning is not a means to an end. We plan so that we can accomplish (both efficiently and effectively) the tasks that need to be done. I believe that planning is vital to accomplishment. But if we never start, then we are wasting time. Implement your plans.
