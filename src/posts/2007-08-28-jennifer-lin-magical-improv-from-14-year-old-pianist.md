She talks about her creative process during composition.

## creativity process

* musical ideas / sketches
* choose one as “main theme”
* choose style to apply to theme and get inspiration from previous work
* make structure – outline / form
* fill in structure w/ ideas
* Polish the details
* Polish the entire piece
