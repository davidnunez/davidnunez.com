Late last year, I inherited a baby iguana from my brother’s friend.

His name is Iggy… I don’t particularly like that name, but I wouldn’t want to change it lest I confuse his reptilian brain.

He has officially outgrown his crib. His tail gets curled up when he tries to turn around. I’m on a mission to build him a more humane place to live that will let him stretch his dewlap.
