Creativity is a skill that needs nourishment, practice, and brutal honesty.

You can’t call yourself a “creative person” unless you are actually living/observing, wondering, learning, tinkering, AND building every single day.

You can’t do any of those things successfully, much less expect anyone to notice unless you share your work… and it is, indeed, work.

[http://www.stretchdaily.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20060202160020/http://stretchdaily.com/) – I met Mark last SxSW. His idea of creatively stretching, daily and holding himself accountable by sharing his results, is brilliant.

I’m going to steal his idea.

Shamelessly.

Brutal honesty? I can’t claim to be a creative person. let’s fix that.
