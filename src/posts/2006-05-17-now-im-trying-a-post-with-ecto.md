I hesitated to use [ecto](http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/) because it never really worked well with Drupal.

I’m liking it for typo. <strike>However, it doesn’t do the “freetagging” stuff very well. It’s notion of tags are technorati tags, which don’t work well for me here. But I’ll see what I can’t hack up.

Specifically, there needs to be a way to convert ecto’s technorati tags mechanism into article “keywords” as implemented in typo.</strike>

…otherwise, I’d need to log in to the site every time I publish an article to do my tagging via the web interface. This is a show stopper.

Apologies up front for the overly geeky topics.

Thursday; May 18, 2006 – 1:02 PM: Turns out ecto supports typo keywords just fine. I’ll worry about technorati sometime later.
