I spent the whole day doing blog updating.

I’m kind of getting excited w/ the way it’s turning out.

In particular, I like the [/archives](https://web.archive.org/web/20050403112620/http://www.davidnunez.com/archives) page. The [homepage](https://web.archive.org/web/20050331065305/http://www.davidnunez.com/) is pretty slick, too.

You can follow along with the progress [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20050403223618/http://www.davidnunez.com/relaunch)

The big thing I’m working on right now is fixing up all the old content to get weird of odd formatting and severely broken links. Also trying to categorize old nodes.

When I get to the bottom of that list (I’m working backwards from 54 pages… I’m on 49 right now), all my nodes will have been tagged (or at least all of the interesting-ish ones will have been tagged.) Furthermore, a set will have been marked as “best of” so that all my favorite posts can be pulled together [in one place](https://web.archive.org/web/20050403113202/http://www.davidnunez.com/bestof).
