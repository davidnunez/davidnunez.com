_memento mori_ is an art term used to describe an image included in a work that reminds the viewer of their own mortality.

These images might appear to be horrific, (ex. grim reaper or dead and decaying bodies), but their intent is to encourage constant readiness; you never know when it’s your turn to go.

I think choosing to own up to “you will die” means that you will not squander your precious heartbeats. You let it go – you let it all go.

You get one at bat, and you either hit it out of the park or you strike out, but the scorecard shows you swung, dammit.

You swung for the fences.

And sometimes _memento mori_ is a short email received on a lazy, Tuesday afternoon.

…and you suddenly realize the pitch is coming over the plate.

R.I.P, friend.
