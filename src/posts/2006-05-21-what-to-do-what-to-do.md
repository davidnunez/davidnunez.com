This is good to know…

[CNN.com – Mad market for used fuel-sippers – May 18, 2006](http://www.cnn.com/2006/AUTOS/05/17/used_compacts/):

In the case of the Prius, the car is nearly impossible to find on dealer’s new car lots. Customers generally have to wait months to get one. And in some ways, a used Prius offers a better value, said James Bell, publisher of IntelliChoice and a Prius owner.

Shoppers trolling lists of used Priuses on Web sites like ebayMotors.com, for example, are looking at actual cars that are available immediately. They have choices of colors and option packages whereas, if they were shopping for a new car, they might have to take whatever is available or wait until they can get what they want.

So, a few thousand miles on the odometer may be a small price to pay, said Bell.

Bell has already bought a second Prius and intends to list his two-year-old one for sale at $25,000, just a few thousand less than he paid for it. He could ask for more.

“I want a quick sale,” he said.
