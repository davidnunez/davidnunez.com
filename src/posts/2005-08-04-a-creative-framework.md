I was flipping through some old idea journals and I found this little diagram I drew, arrogantly titled, “David’s Guide To Cultivating Ideas”

I’ll scan it in, but it was 5 circles: Live/Observe, Wonder, Tinker, Learn, and Build with various arrows connecting them and the arrows were labeled “Share.”

You can draw it yourself:

- Live/Observe points to Wonder  
- Wonder Points to Tinker  
- Wonder Points to Learn  
- Tinker Points to Learn  
- Learn Points to Tinker  
- Learn Points to Build  
- Build Points to Live/Observe

As I stared at the diagram, I had this odd thought, **“What an incredibly interesting way to tag blog entries.”**
