I had a nice dinner with a [couple](http://www.donturn.com) friends (both very smart and both very geeky… my kind of people) and I got all inspired by some conversation we had about our various media consumption habits.

I was interested not only in what their particular sources of information were (newspapers, magazines, etc), but also what their particular reading and notetaking habits were.
