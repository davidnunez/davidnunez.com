A little over a month ago, Dorkbot dropped from outer space onto an audience of over 120 curiosity seekers, geekophiles, and mad scientists.

We were featured on News 8 Austin and had a write-up of our inaugural insanity (with some great photos of the presenters’ dangerous creations) in the Austin American Statesman last Saturday:

“Get your dork on – Grownups who like to play with electricity get a charge out of showing off their projects at Dorkbot Austin.”

And now we’re at it again!

If you know what’s best for you and for humanity, you will NOT miss Dorkbot Austin 2 Thursday, July 13 8PM Cafe Mundi

Dorkbot Austin 2  
June 13, 2006 – 8:00PM  
Cafe Mundi, 1704 East 5th St.  
Very kid-friendly event.

Please forward this email to everyone you know… before it’s too late.

It’s a celebration of tinkering – people doing strange thing with electricity. Fringe finding at its finest.

We have some amazing presentations lined up:

* Joel Greenberg demonstrates how to beat movie studios at their own game with his cost-effective zeppelin microphone

* disturbed members of Austin’s very own Robot Group (<http://www.robotgroup.net>) bring the relentless sea shanty singing Babbling Head. Be very afraid.

* Rich LeGrand, from Charmed Labs, shows you how coerce a Nintendo Game Boy and some legos into a robot – one that can see images and can be controlled over the Internet

* jamie O’shea shows off creations including his Wamcam – a device that prints photos on your eyes instead of film

In addition, You’re invited to show off your dark, garage experiments (you know, the one that creeps out your neighbors and runs up the power bill) during “Open Dork,” a rapid-fire open mic.

DJ KDH spins between presentations.

Hope to see you there!
