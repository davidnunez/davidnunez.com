I would also want to add a taxonomy of tags related solely to individual projects and project categories so I could find all posts applicable to a project.

How is this different than blogs and journals?

Is my blog an online sketchbook / idea journal?

Will readers be bored with the massive flow of half-baked ideas?

Maybe the blog shows built items only w/ “see creative process” links to the supporting items.

But then, I lose the “share” component of creative framework?

Perhaps that can just be a different data stream.
