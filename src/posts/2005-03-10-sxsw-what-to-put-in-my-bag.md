Here are some things I’m putting in my “Carry around” bag:

* A Big Bottle of Water – this is technically a no-no. You’ll need it to avoid insane convention center refreshment monopoly surcharges, though.
* Trail mix or other keep-me-going medicine (see above)
* Gum / Mints / sucking candy (since you’ll be talking to so many people, your throat is going to get sore, right?)
* Cell Phone w/ my # on speed dial: (~~Redacted~~)
* Notepad / paper
* Twice as many pens as you think you’ll need (since they will be lost) and a yellow marker
* Lots and lots of business cards
* a separate folder or bag or envelope for incoming business cards
* SxSWi Program
* Camera
* USB Drive (_Thanks [Don](http://www.donturn.com)_)
* Sticky Notes (_Thanks [Don](http://www.donturn.com)_)
* Wetnaps (added Thursday; March 9, 2006)

They usually give out the conference schedule on little cards you can fold up and stick into your badge pouch.
