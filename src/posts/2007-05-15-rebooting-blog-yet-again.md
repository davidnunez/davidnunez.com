I was making a list of things I wanted to do with my personal website. Before SxSW I spent many hours getting the blog running [mephisto](http://www.mephistoblog.com), for no other reason than it’s written with Ruby on Rails. I wanted to eat my own dogfood, etc.

As I was looking at my list of blog enhancements I wanted to spend time building, I realized that the [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) community has already accomplished most of these items and that it would take me months if not years to reinvent those wheels w/ mephisto.

So, I had to make a decision. Was I in all of this to wrestle with my web publishing platform? Does “build mephisto plugins for a relatively small community” satisfy my life purpose.

No.

I’m also exploring some ideas after reading [4 hour workweek](http://fourhourworkweek.com/) that would be much more quickly implemented via one-click installs of wordpress.

I visited the websites for a handful of people who are doing interesting work that I admire, secretly envy, and wish to become… not one of them was using mephisto, and most were using wordpress or blogger — that sealed the deal.

So wordpress it is.

There is some more work to be done:

* conversion of old posts to wordpress… I have many years of content to convert
* conversion of my davidnunez.com mephisto theme to wordpress template

I also feel like I have to play catchup to understand the architecture and development path of wordpress. Wading through plugins, alone, is going to be a daunting task.

I found some [plugins](http://web.archive.org/web/20111123172728/http://blog.circlesixdesign.com:80/download) I installed right away to help w/ using textmate as a blog management tool with tags (a la [Ultimate Tag Warrior](http://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior)).
