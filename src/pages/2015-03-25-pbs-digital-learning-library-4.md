The PBS Digital Learning Library (DLL) application contains hundreds of videos, images, lesson plans, documents, audio clips, interactives and more on a mammoth range of subjects. The iPad client allows teachers to search and present these items in the classroom and to display previously-created playlists in a variety of methods. Most features were fully implemented in only a five-week development cycle.

This app was created for internal use for PBS as a cornerstone for a Department of Education grant proposal. The app allows teachers to search a large, rich repository of multimedia material suitable for use in many curriculums. Playlist support, map and time layouts, and embedded video support make this app lush, usable and a real benefit to teachers in the classroom.

The app accessed the online repository via XML requests and utilized Airplay to send video content to in-classroom display screens.
