Thank you so much for taking a chance on my newsletter.

It's such an impossibility to me that you are here, reading this.

Thank you. Seriously. Thank you.

It's been a long while since I've been so excited about making something for friends without needing that elusive and ultimately disappointing "buy-in" from clients and stakeholders.

I've been sending these out on a weekly basis, aiming for Thursday or Friday morning.

Please do let me know what you think of all this. In the meantime, you can read all the [past episodes](https://davidnunez.com/newsletter/). My favorites are [#4 Happy Upgrade Day](https://davidnunez.com/happy-upgrade-day/) and [#5 Freediving into a Spreadsheet](https://davidnunez.com/freediving-into-a-spreadsheet/).
