My studiomates and I created an app and physical interaction mechanism that was released on the Apple app store on the day of the iPad launch.

\[su\_custom\_gallery source=”media: 2147,2148,2149,2150,2151,2152,2153,2154,2155,2156,2157,2158,2159,2160,2161,2162,2163,2164″ limit=”29″ link=”lightbox” title=”never”\]

We were able to simulate touch events on the iPhone or iPad by creating “fingertips” with salty sponges wrapped in a latex glove. Since the iPhone is able to handle multiple touch events, having an object built around different sets of “fingers” of a particular count and configuration allows users to interact with the iPad in a more physical way.

We had made the iPad app Akina with this in mind; to have flowers and vines spring up from the path of these moving plant creatures.

Designed by DINO, the unique, textless interface encourages you to explore composition through the organic growth of wildflowers. With just five different plants to cultivate, you can create amazingly different compositions.
