ABCs and Animals is a universal iPhone/iPad application providing interactive alphabet learning flashcards. The player taps on various portions of each flashcard to cause animals to move, objects to make sounds, and even stars to appear and disappear. Targeted at young children, ABCs and Animals is an excellent companion to traditional materials for learning the alphabet. It is designed to account for the limited motor skills of a younger learner.

Built around an XML description file, the core code of the app was designed to be heavily reused with alternate assets to create a variety of additional flashcard apps. The XML description language was created to be simple enough for a non-programmer to edit and defines all images, sounds and animations (both frame-based and procedural) throughout the app.
