This app, created for J.K. Rowling’s children’s charity, Lumos International, played a key role in a major fundraising campaign. Implementing in-app purchases, the app was able to collect funds for the charity through the purchase of virtual birthday candles, complete with interactive flames. I produced the app under an extremely short time frame (3 weeks) to launch in time for International Children’s Day.

I completely created the design for this app including the custom icons, realtime “mapped news” interface, and candle blowing interaction. It allowed for users to support the charity by purchasing upgraded virtual candles via in-app purchasing.

This app includes a standard UI-Kit tab controller with custom icons, many custom, interactive UIViews, OpenGL particle systems, and full in-app purchase support. Content is loaded dynamically from website feeds whenever updated, but ships with a default content set and a robust cacheing system to enable app use even without network connectivity.
