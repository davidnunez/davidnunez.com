I developed a mobile game for a company interested in educating young people about responsible financial health (ex. staying out of debt, avoiding credit cards, and creating savings goals).

In an extremely short timeframe I created the app in Unity 3D for iPhone & iPad. Shortly after the launch of the first version (successful and fast App Store acceptance with no rejection), I was able to create an Android-based port in a week.

It was ultimately released in the Apple App Store, Android Market, and the Amazon AppStore.

The game features 21 unique levels that are unlocked as users successfully completed goals.

Fat cats involved physics simulation, cinematic (Ken Burns style) cut scenes, particle generator rewards, parallax scrolling and special character power ups.

The app also included simple integration with Facebook, Twitter, and email for social sharing purposes.
