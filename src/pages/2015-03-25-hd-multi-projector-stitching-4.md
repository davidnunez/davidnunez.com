I developed a prototype hardware and software system for stitching together multiple high definition projectors for indoor display. I researched and specified a complete display package that included proper rear-projection screens, high lumen projectors, and multiplexing splitters.

The main challenge was to create a simple calibration system that used a web cam to automatically determine the location and keystone distortion of each projected display to correctly stitch together a complete image, adjusting for overlap brightness and other image distortion to provide a complete, seamless display.

I developed custom software to accomplish this and render the properly adjusted images calculate the homography between a camera and the array of projectors.

The initial prototype was installed in a shopping mall in California.
