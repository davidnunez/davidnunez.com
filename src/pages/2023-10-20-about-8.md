Over the past twenty years working with non-profits, startups, and brands, I have developed an unwavering belief in a hands-on approach to innovation research: the best way to understand a topic is through rapid and soulful prototyping with near-future technologies.  
	
Since making is always entangled with understanding, my hands will always be covered in source code regardless of my job title. To explore how digital tools influence what we make, I write software for cognitive augmentation and digital productivity.

At MIT, I lead the Museum in its digital transformation as it reboots in a new building opening in 2022. My digital approach supports improved collections access, innovative digital experiences, and more consistent ongoing audience engagement.  
	
My research interests include source code marginalia, technology culture, esoteric programming languages, and augmented personal productivity systems. I seek to illuminate the humanity that exists around and inside computation.
