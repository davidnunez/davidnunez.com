I worked for The Capital Area Training Foundation, non-profit in Austin, TX where I directed the IT, Digital Media, and Games cluster of companies, schools, and Universities.

Our goal was to help regional economic development through the training of K-12 students and educators in industry-relevant areas.

I designed and deployed a summer teacher institute around mobile video game development. The teachers were incentivized to create shared curriculum and lesson plans around the content delivered in a week long event. They toured active game studios, labs at Universities, and worked on team projects together. The Institute satisfied professional development credits for the teachers and some of their lesson plans were adapted as part of curriculum in HS Computer Science classes in Texas.

We also hosted a very large regional job fair for area high school students to learn about the variety of career options among multiple sectors.
